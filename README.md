# SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog

**SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC)** is a json-based metadata standard to describe geospatial data. STAC is an open-source project who's goal is to make geospatial data more easily worked with, indexed, and discovered. STAC is a great option if you are a data provider that would like to make your data more open and accessible to the world. 

The [Open Forest Observatory(OFO)](https://openforestobservatory.org/) is indexing all datasets using the STAC json metadata standard and also serving out the data through a STAC compliant API.
