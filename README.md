# SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog

**SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC)** is a json-based metadata standard to describe geospatial data. STAC is an open-source project who's goal is to make geospatial data more easily worked with, indexed, and discovered. STAC is a great option is you are a data provider that would like to make your data more open and accessible to the world. 

The Open Forest Observatory is indexing all datasets using the STAC json metadata standard and also serving out the data through a STAC compliant API.
